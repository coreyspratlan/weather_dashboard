# weather_dashboard

This is a weather app that allows users to search for the current weather conditions in multiple cities so they may plan a trip based on those conditions.

Using the openweathermap api and api key, I was able to dynamically change html elements using AJAX call/response and jQuery to gather and display data about weather conditions by city search results.  The following information that is displayed on the app: 

        * temperature
        * humidity
        * wind speed
        * date
        * weather icons to give a visual of what the weather is currently for that city.

This app would be perfect for world travelers seeking to make travel plans based on weather conditions.
